# Artwork

## Artwork is a program for generating and minting NFTs, written in Go (https://golang.org/).

### This project is in the early planning stages. Please be patient as it is built it out, or potentially destroyed.

The goal of this package is to provide a tool to make generating and minting your NFT on the Chia Blockchain, fairly simple. If you need something more fully-featured, check out HashLips (https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine)
